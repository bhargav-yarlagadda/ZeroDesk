Got it üëç Since you‚Äôre building an **AnyDesk clone** for learning/system-level exploration, I‚Äôll draft a **professional README.md** template you can use and adapt for your project.

Here‚Äôs a **starter README**:

```markdown
# ZeroDesk

ZeroDesk is a lightweight **remote desktop application** inspired by AnyDesk/TeamViewer.  
It allows users to **share their screen, transmit keystrokes, and control remote systems** in real time.  
This project is built as a **learning experiment** to understand networking, real-time communication, and system-level programming.

## üöÄ Features
- üîë **Authentication** ‚Äì JWT-based login sessions  
- üë• **Role Selection** ‚Äì choose between `Viewer` (control) or `Sharer` (share screen)  
- üñ• **Screen Sharing** ‚Äì real-time transmission of screen pixels  
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keystroke Transmission** ‚Äì send keyboard/mouse events from viewer to sharer  
- ‚ö° **Low Latency** ‚Äì powered by WebRTC / WebSockets (depending on config)  
- üõ° **Secure Communication** ‚Äì encrypted sessions  

---

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + React / Electron (for desktop integration)  
- **Backend**: Go (Golang) + WebSockets (Socket.IO / custom)  
- **Auth**: JWT for session management  
- **Transport**: WebRTC (P2P) / fallback to WebSockets
